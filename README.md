# Stock market news and stock market price analysis

The aim of this project is to compare the sentimens of stock market news with stock prices and figure out the relation between two different datasets.I will try to answer **"Is there any relationship between stock market news and stock market prices?"**

I will get the news by web scraping on [The Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/). I will analyse **Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Netflix** companies.

## Findings

In the project I tried to answer the question **" Is there any relationship between stock market news and stock market prices?"** by comparing sentiment analysis of specific news and stock prices of that news' date. 

Our visualisation plots show the correlation between news and stock values. 
When we check the sentiment scores and close value of that day of particular day, the positive or negative news sentiment scores affects the  close stock price of that particular. 

As a result, I successfully achieved my project goal by proofing the relationship between stock news and stock market prices.
